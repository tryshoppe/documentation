# Getting Started with Shoppe

This series of tutorials will guide you through building an entire (albeit basic) store
using Shoppe. It will cover getting up and running, displaying your catalog as well as
the whole order flow process.

In this tutorial, we're going to set up Shoppe from scratch into a brand new 
Rails application. We're assuming that you have Rails, Ruby, RubyGems & Bundler
installed at their latest versions. This guide was produced using Rails 4.0.0 & Ruby 2.0.

During this tutorial, we will execute commands such as `rails` or `rake`. You may find
you need to prefix these commands with `bundle exec` depending on your local system
setup.
