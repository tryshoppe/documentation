# Shoppe Documentation

This repository contains all the documentation which is pulled into the Shoppe website.

If you wish to make changes or suggest documentation, please feel free to submit pull
requests to this repository for inclusion in the website.

* All documentation must be written in Markdown.
* We used fenced code blocks with a language specifier when adding blocks of code.
* We only support headings up to h5 as all headings are incremented by one when displaying them
  in the website.
